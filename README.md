### SearchASL ###
Utilizes a local text file to store ASL signs based on their attributes and allows user to search for a sign based on its qualities, add new signs, and edit stored signs. Organizes results by most likely to least likely based on their similarity to search criteria, not including fields left blank.

### Development ###
This project was started in August 2023 and is currently in development, with a goal of creating a fully functional application by December 2023. Following this, my goal is to utilize Firebase to create non-local storage for signs, allowing access to a user's stored data from any device.
